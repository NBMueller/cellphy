# CellPhy: accurate and fast probabilistic inference of single-cell phylogenies

## Installation

0. Supported operating systems: currently, Linux and macOS only.

1. Clone GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/amkozlov/cellphy
```

2. Install dependencies

CellPhy is using the bundled [RAxML-NG](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng) to perform tree inference, hence this core functionality is available without installing any dependencies.
However, some additional features (tree visualization, format conversion etc.) rely on external software. So in order to have a fully functional pipeline, it is *highly recommended* to install following packages:

1. [bcftools](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools)
2. [R environment](https://www.r-project.org/)
3. R packages: [ggtree](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree) and its dependencies (treeio, ape...)

For Ubuntu and RedHat/CentOS Linux, we provide a script for automatic dependency installation:

```
cd cellphy
sudo ./install.sh  
```

3. Check that everything works:

```
./cellphy.sh
```

## Usage

Standard analysis with default parameters:
```
./cellphy.sh input.vcf
```

General syntax:
```
./cellphy.sh [COMMAND] [options] input.vcf
```

COMMAND:
- `FULL`        Full analysis: Thorough tree search + bootstrapping + mutation mapping (default)

- `SEARCH`      Thorough tree search (20 starting trees) + mutation mapping 

- `FAST`        Fast tree search (single starting tree) + mutation mapping

Options:
- `-g FILE`     Tab-delimited list of SNVs for mapping, with respective gene names ([example](https://github.com/amkozlov/cellphy/blob/master/example/CRC24.MutationsMap))

- `-m MODEL`    Evolutionary model definition in [RAxML-NG format](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng/wiki/Input-data#single-model)<br>
                **NOTE**: partitioned models are not supported at the moment!

- `-o OUTGR`    Outgroup taxon list (comma-separated), e.g. `-o healthy` or `-o H1,H2`

- `-p PREFIX`   Prefix for output files (default: input filename w/o extension)

- `-r`          REDO mode: overwrite all result files

- `-t THREADS`  Number of threads to use (default: autodetect)

- `-y`          Skip mutation mapping          

- `-z`          Skip tree plotting (no PDF/SVG output)
